# Furever-Friends: Group Project 03

## Very Important Note: 

This is a fresh repository that was created due to some major version control issues we encountered on the original repository. We have pieced together our functioning code and placed it on this repo.

## Description

As a potential pet owner, I want to use a pet adoption app to find my perfect furry companion.
I start by opening the pet adoption app and browsing through the available pets. I can filter my search by pet type, breed, age, and location to find pets that match my preferences.
I find a few pets that I'm interested in and click on their profiles to learn more about them. The profiles include pictures, descriptions, and information about the pet's personality, health, and behavior.
If I find a pet that I'm interested in adopting, I can contact the adoption agency directly through the app to ask questions or schedule a visit. I can also save pets that I'm interested in for future reference.
Once I've found the perfect pet, I can complete the adoption process through the app. This includes filling out an adoption application, submitting references, and paying any adoption fees.
Finally, I can use the app to stay connected with the adoption agency and receive updates about my new pet, including information about training, health care, and socialization opportunities.
With the pet adoption app, I feel confident that I can find my perfect furry companion and provide them with a loving forever home.

# Introduction

# Author(s)
This app was created as a collaboration between Jeffrey Ackerman, Rhonda, Alec and Austin. The group worked together to accomplish the final product, which required some overlap, however the initial assignments had Jeffrey and Austin working on Front-End and Alec and Rhonda working on the Back-End.

## Usage

Clone the repo to you desktop. Open with VSCode. Run NMP I from the client directory. If needs be, also run NPM I on the root. Then run npm run develop from the root and the page will load on localhost:3000. At this time, after countless hours of trial and error, we have not gotten the app to successfully load on Heroku.
